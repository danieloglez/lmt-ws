12-310,12-310,Mikuni Dual Carb Primer Kit,44.95,26.95,True,,"Jet ski primer kits are a cure for hard starting jet ski motors. If your watercraft is one of those machines that require a lot of choking when the PWC engine is cold to get it started, we would recommend installing a primer kit to your carburetors.

Each kit comes with plenty of fuel resistant polyurethane hose that is good up to 180 degrees and comes with all fittings, tees and zip ties to prevent leaks.

Primer systems work well because they draw fuel directly to the carburetors without turning the engine over and in turn give the carburetor a blast of fuel for easy starting. Using a primer kit to prime your engine will prevent flooding the engine and save on extended cranking time to get the engine to fire. Primer kits are available for all types of carburetors and are simple to install.

2006 Is a mid year break for the Sea-Doo 4TEC. To determine which crankshaft you have , you must know where your locating pin is. With the timing mark at 9:00, where is your locating pin? 2:00 or 5:00.

You can not interchange the 2006 and up with the 2005 and earlier editions. New stretch bolts should be used to prevent both torque loss and possible engine failure when rebuilding an engine.
